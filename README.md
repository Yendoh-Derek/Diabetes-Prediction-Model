Diabetes Prediction Model
This project implements a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on health-related metrics such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and other features. The dataset used is the Diabetes Prediction Dataset.

Features
Input Variables: Includes metrics such as glucose level, blood pressure, insulin levels, BMI, and more.
Output: A binary classification indicating whether a person is diabetic (1) or not diabetic (0).
Algorithm: Utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for prediction.
Steps:
Data preprocessing:
Handling missing values, scaling features using StandardScaler.
Model Training:
The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
An SVM model is trained on the standardized features.
Evaluation:
Accuracy and performance of the model are evaluated using metrics like accuracy_score.
How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Run the notebook or script to preprocess the dataset, train the model, and make predictions.
